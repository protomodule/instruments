*Protomodule* is a set of common practices which span from coding over CI/CD to production deployments. Every utility within Protomodule is able to provide core functionality as a standalone tool. All Protomodule utilities are interoperable to get the most out of your DevOps pipeline with minimum effort.

*Instruments* is the JavaScript module to integrate Protomodules principles into browser based applications.

**üö® This library is under heavy development.** Be sure to check back for breaking changes in future releases.

## Quick start guide

Install *Protomodule | Instruments* by running:

```console
$ npm install --save @protomodule/instruments
```

## Features

### Type-safe environment variables

To access environment variables in a type-safe way create a singleton module with your specific environment schema:

`./config.ts`
```js
import { fromWeb, requiredStr } from "@protomodule/instruments"

export const config = fromWeb({
  REACT_APP_API_URL: requiredStr(),
})
```

In any other part of your application when you need to access an environment variable use:

```js
import { config } from "./config.ts"

console.log(config.REACT_APP_API_URL)
```

In addition to providing a typed configuration object *Protomodule | Instruments* also check the variables at runtime and will show an alert and ultimatly throw an error when trying to access an invalid configuration.

### üñ•  Setting environment variables locally

During development this is meant to be used in conjunction with `react-script`. Therefore you have direct access to your local environment variables.

### üåç  Setting environment variables in production

This library follows the *Protomodule* practice of loading environment variables into `window.env` in the browser.

This can be achieved by adding a snippet to your HTML's head section:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/env.js"></script>
 ...
```

`env.js` file should serve to following content:
```js
window.env = {
  REACT_APP_API_URL: "https://...",
};
```

If you use the *Protomodule* related build tools, this file may be generated automatically when configured.
